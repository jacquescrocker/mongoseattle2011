    <ul>
      <li>
        just use the mongo driver directly
      </li>
      <li>
        don't bother with complex ORMs (Mongoid, MongoMapper, etc)<br>
        they'll just slow you down
      </li>
      <li>
        keep data unstructured, create lots of collections. <br>pull the data you need when you need it
      </li>
    </ul>
